## Aim:
To create a basic UiPath workflow that displays a “Hello World” message box to the user, demonstrating the use of the Message Box activity.

## Procedure:
# Open UiPath Studio
Launch UiPath Studio on your system.
From the Start screen, select Process to create a new automation project.
Give it a name (e.g., HelloWorldProject) and click Create.
# Add a Sequence
In the Design tab, click on New → Sequence.
Name the sequence (e.g., HelloWorldSequence).
A blank sequence workflow will open in the designer panel.
# Insert a Message Box Activity
From the Activities Panel (usually on the left), search for Message Box.
Drag and drop the Message Box activity into the sequence.
# Configure the Message Box
In the Properties panel or directly in the activity, set the Text field to:

"Hello World"

# Save the Workflow
Click Save to store your workflow.
# Run the Workflow
Click the Run button from the toolbar.
A pop-up message box with “Hello World” will appear.

## Output:

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8b858bd-bb4f-4adc-baca-5a9dbe771cde" />


## Result:
The UiPath workflow was successfully executed, and a message box displaying “Hello World” appeared on the screen. This confirms that the workflow was created and run correctly.
